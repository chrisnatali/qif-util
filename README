qif-utils is a very small set of small tools to manipulate QIF files, 
 written sloppily in a very small amount of time.
 
IF SWALLOWED, DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING - SEEK MEDICAL ASSISTANCE IMMEDIATELY.

Having used Gnucash very happily for a decade, I've always irritated by
the manual method I needed to perform to map transactions to accounts.
This code was written to automate some of that process, and posted in
case anyone else can benefit from it.  However, do not rely on this code
for anything significant -- only about 20 hours was put into development,
most being spent tweaking the output process to give me something usable.

There is no documentation other than this file, and there are no comments
in the code.  There is also no error checking.  You have been warned.
 
All utilities accept input and output parameters the same way:
	Input can be supplied as a filename argument, or on stdin.
	Output can be received on stdout, or as a filename argument
		(only if Input is supplied as filename argument)
		
qif-augment [-n name] [-t type] [-a initial-account] [-d initial-date]
            [-i initial balance] [input.qif] [output.qif]
	-n Assign or override the name of the account in this qif file
	-t Assign or override the type of the account in this qif file
	-i Insert a transaction for the initial balance of this account
	-d The date of the initial balance transaction
	-a The source account/category for the initial balance transaction
		
qif-categorize -r rules.file  [input.qif] [output.qif]
	-r A file containing the rules describing category assignment
		(see doc/test.rules for example)
		
qif-csv [input.qif] [output.qif]
	Outputs QIF information as a CSV, with fixed, hardcoded columns

Example:
  ./qif-augment -n "Liabilities:Credit Cards:Bank of Forsetti Credit Card"     \
    -t CCard -i -200.00 -a "Equity:Opening Balances" -d 12/01/2013 doc/test.qif\
    | ./qif-categorize -r doc/test.rules | ./qif-csv
